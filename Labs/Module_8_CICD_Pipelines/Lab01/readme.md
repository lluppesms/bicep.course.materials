# Module 9: Collaborating with Git in Visual Studio Code  - Lab guides

## Microsoft Learn Labs

1. Deploy Azure resources by using Bicep and Azure Pipelines - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/training/modules/build-first-bicep-deployment-pipeline-using-azure-pipelines/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/training/modules/build-first-bicep-deployment-pipeline-using-azure-pipelines/)

2. Deploy Azure resources by using Bicep and GitHub Actions - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/training/modules/build-first-bicep-deployment-pipeline-using-github-actions/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/training/modules/build-first-bicep-deployment-pipeline-using-github-actions/)

## Course Labs

In this lab, we will walk through these examples in ascending order, building on the concepts outlined for each pipeline.

| File | Description |
| -- | -- |
| 01-simplest-pipeline | The simplest YML file example with hard-coded values |
| 02-pipeline-with-parms | This YML file uses user parameters to deploy resources |
| 03-pipeline-with-variable-file | This pipeline shows how to put variables in a YML var file |
| 04-pipeline-with-bicep-parm-file | This pipeline shows how to use a Bicep Parameter file so that your YML is not hard-coded with variable names |
| 05-pipeline-merging-variable-file-and-bicep-parm-file | This pipeline shows how to merge variables into a Bicep Parameter File |
| 06-pipeline-with-template | This pipeline pulls out the code in pipeline 05 and creates a reusable template for deploying resources |
| 07-pipeline-with-scanning-template | This pipeline adds in a code scanning template |
| 08-pipeline-build-deploy-app | This pipeline uses all of the above concepts, then adds in a build and deploy template to deploy a live app |
| 09-pipeline-build-deploy-app | This pipeline shows how to deploy to multiple stages (i.e. DEV/QA/PROD)  |
| 99-example-library-pipeline | This example shows how to use external templates from another repository |
| 99-example-pr-pipeline | This pipeline is an example that can get kicked off whenever a PR is submitted as part of the PR |
| 99-example-scan-pipeline | This pipeline is an example of a job that can do a security scan on a scheduled basis. |
